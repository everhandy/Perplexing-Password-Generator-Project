# Perplexing-Password-Generator-Project

## Description:

This project represents and assignment where I was tasked with creating an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected.  This application runs in the user's web browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote.
